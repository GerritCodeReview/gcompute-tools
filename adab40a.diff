 The daemon launches itself into the background and continues
 to keep the OAuth2 access token fresh.
+
+## Installation on Windows
+
+1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) for Windows if they are not.
+1. Run `git-cookie-authdaemon` in the same environment under the same user
+   git commands will be run, for exmaple in either Command Prompt or Cygwin bash
+   shell for user `builder`.
+```
+python git-cookie-authdaemon --nofork
+```
+
+### Lauch at Windows boot
+
+It may be desired in automation to launch `git-cookie-authdaemon` at
+Windows boot. It can be done as a scehduled task. The following is an
+example on a Jenkins node. The setup is:
+
+1. The VM is created from GCE Windows Server 2012R2 image.
+1. Gygwin with SSHD is installed.
+1. Jenkins master launches the node through SSH as `builder` account.
+
+How to create a scheduled task.
+
+1. Launch Task Scheduler from an Administrator account.
+1. In `General` tab:
+   1. Change user to the one running Jenkins node if it is different. You may
+      want to run Jenkins node as a non-priviledged user, `builder` in this
+      example.
+   1. Select `Run whether user is logged on or not`
+1. In `Trigger` tab. Add a trigger
+   1. `Begin the task` as `At startup`.
+   1. Uncheck `Stop task if it runs longer than`.
+   1. Check `Enabled`.
+1. In `Actions` tab.  Add `Start a program`.
+   1. `Program/script` as `C:\cygwin64\bin\bash.ext`,
+   1. `Add arguments` as
+      `--login -c /home/builder/git-cookie-authdaemon_wrapper.sh` (see note
+      below)
+1. Add 'builder' account to Administrative Tools -> Local Security Policy ->
+   Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment -> Log On As Batch Job
+
+
+Note: debugging a scheduled task is not streightforward. A wrapper like
+`/home/builder/git-cookie-authdaemon_wrapper.sh` below can be helpful to capture git-cookie-autodaemon.log errors.
+
+```
+python <path_to>/git-cookie-authdaemon --nofork >> git-cookie-autodaemon.log  # option --debug is also available.
+```
